# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Reflection
For this project I implemented a Proportion/Integral/Derivative (PID) Controller to control the steering of a simulated car.  

For the PID coefficients (Kp, Ki, and Kd), I started by manually experimenting with values to find a setting that allowed the car to go around the track.  I started with keeping the Ki and Kd at zero and experimenting with Kp.  I was able to find a setting that allowed the car to travel straight sections of track though zig-zagging wildly.   I then added values for Kd which dampened the zig-zag motion and eventually was able to get the car to do a complete lap.   The Ki value seemed to only make the performance worse with any value other than zero (I assume the simulated care has no systematic bias, e.g. "drift").

I then implemented a "twiddle" class to allow me to automate finding better coefficients.  I start accumulating the error after a set amount of time steps, and then "twiddle" the coefficients after another set amount of time steps pass.  I then reset the simulator and PID controller and start over.

I found that no setting was able to stop the oscillation of the car, especially after a turn.  I added some rudimentary speed control by decreasing the throttle value based on the seer angle (even allowing "braking" via negative throttle) and that seemed to greatly improve the oscillation problem.

* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
